# seal-microservices
Based on https://onelab.udemy.com/course/microservices-architecture-and-implementation-on-dotnet/

Hopefully, I try to use that and add some services that make more sense for SEAL along the way...
Not sure though, I have met many obstacle course when trying that. XD

## Notes

- Folder structure
  - './src': refers to the VS Studio Solution bundle => this looks like a general common practice

- When creating projects, we add actual folders to the location within the repostory, not just using the Solution folder
  - e.g. When creating the Catalog.API project, we set the location of the project to be ./src/Services/Catalog (this part is manual)
